    "content": "Description . Women who are at increased risk for breast cancer without current or previous diagnosis of breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) can be referred to a breast specialty clinic to consider risk reduction interventions. Clinical Review . | USPSTF has age &gt;= 35 years for inclusion criteria in the chemoprevention guideline. Are there risk reduction modalities that would merit referral before age 35? | USPSTF does include life expectancy criteria in considering referral but NCCN specifies life expectancy ≥10 years. Should this be an exclusion criteria? | Are there conditions other than known genetic mutation/syndrome and thoracic RT that should prompt referral to specialist, without first requesting formal risk assessment by PCP? . | USPSTF cites “presence of atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ on a prior biopsy” as a potential risk factor. ADH or LCIS alone do not seem to confer &gt;3% 5 year risk on either BCSC or BCRAT (for ADH) models. Should presence trigger referral or only if model indicates high risk in combination with other risk factors? | . | Which factors should prompt recommendation to assess risk using a formal risk assessment model, taking into consideration risk of over-prompting and asking PCP to complete too many risk assessments? . | Limit to the common criteria collected between the risk models? Limited number of shared criteria, will exclude some such as brast density. | NCCN includes ‘Pedigree suggestive of genetic predisposition’ and ‘Compelling family history of breast cancer’ as factors to consider, however family history based tools do not overlap with personal risk probability tools. Recommending assessment on patient with any documented family history will lead to high number of prompts. | Should this be omitted entirely, given high reliance on clinical intuition in USPSTF guideline making digital version non-specific. | . | USPSTF text does not make a strong recommendation regarding risk assessment method or cutoff, but suggests &gt;= 3% risk for breast cancer in the next 5 years may benefit most from risk reduction. Is this a reasonable cutoff to suggest referral? NCCN uses 1.7% 5 year risk threshold or 10-year risk ≥5% (IBIS). | USPSTF suggests risk should be re-assessed “when there is a significant change in breast cancer risk factors”, including new family member diagnosis or new atypical breast biopsy. Is it reasonable to consider data to be “new” if it was entered in the period since the last mammogram was done, in order to prevent prompting indefinitely? | .

    "content": "This document includes a semi-structured representation of evidence-based narrative guidelines for breast cancer screening. Semi-structured representation, also known as Level 2 representation, of guideline content and recommendations is essential for the development of computable clinical decision support (CDS) artifacts. It includes: . | High-level and mid-level flow diagrams that visually illustrate portions of the guidelines. | A brief description of each portion of the CDS logic. | Semi-structured logic statements that list required clinical concepts, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, events (decision points), and actions (output, e.g. recommendations). | . How to Navigate the Specification . Start with Pathway. This page includes: . | High-level flow diagram, which visually illustrates the main logic paths translated, applicable guidelines, and order of precedence and dependencies among logic paths. | A combined view of mid-level flow diagrams, which provide a more detailed view of each logic path and how they relate to each other. | . Each logic path has a dedicated page under Logic Paths, which includes the mid-level flow diagram for the path, as well as semi-structured logic statements. These may refer to: . | Data elements: logic statements used multiple times across the specification; and | Terminology: clinical concepts that will eventually be represented by lists of codes. | Supporting logic paths: additional logic paths referenced by one or more of the main logic paths. | . Note . Several sections and pages are under active development and may be sparsely populated or likely to undergo significant modifications. Instructions for TEP Members . | For each cycle of review, we will ask you to focus on specific sections and logic paths, with special attention to the questions under the Clinical Review section in each page. | The focus of clinical validation should be on the faithful translation of guideline recommendations and the resolution of clinical ambiguities and areas of ommission in the guidelines. | The terminology section is very sparsely populated at this time, and can be ignored. | If you have questions about the specification or need clarification please do not hesitate to reach out to breast-cds-list@mitre.org | .
